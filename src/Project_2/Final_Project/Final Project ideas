what can I apply every concept of probability and stats we have learned so far?

gw2 loot bags?
independent 
no dependence

black lion chests? 
loot boxes but have no pity point system.
so no dependence.

actually dependence is found in rarity probability. 

maybe purchases have associated dependence on available items?

conditional probability of getting a desired item based on its rarity.

also rate of purchase can depend on change in loot tables: seasonal events, wizards vault, etc. 

does data mining upcoming sales change loot box purchase rates?

statistics
average cost to get rare or higher item
money spent per week in relation to play time
total money spent over career of play
