Write a program which determines the probability of any two people in a group having the same birthday.

Control the input so the user can determine how many people are in the group.

Make a Person Class with int birthday.

Make # of runs configurable (eg. user input in main.)

Notes:
1/365 The probability of a birthday being any one day.
For the sample space -
E1 = 1 = 365/365 First Person is equally likely to have any one birthday
E2 = 364/365 Second Person
E3 = 363/365 Third... and so on.
En = 1 x 364/365 x 363/365 x ... x 365-n/365
(Conditional Probability) - B Given A in this example is E2|E1, E3|E2, etc.
Equates to the permutations formula n!/(n - r)!
